## About
This is my take on the mock sign-up form project from The Odin Project curriculum using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

## Project Description
The goal was to implement my knowledge of HTML forms wherein I was able to use form validation, form styling, and basic form structuring. Along with this, I tried to apply new css selector concepts I learned such as pseudo- and attribute-selectors.
